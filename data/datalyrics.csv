Yeah...
Yeah hey
Oh yes
Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin]
Can this be true?
Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Justin with Chris]
I never thought that love could feel like this
And then you change my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle

[Chorus: All, Justin]
Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

New York City
You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you twenty-one questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, Cover your eyes
Cause smokin' with me, you go blind
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano, but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

It’s Christmastime and there’s no need to be afraid
At Christmastime, we let in light, and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime

[Verse 2: Paloma Faith, Emeli Sandé, Guy Garvey, Dan Smith, Angélique Kidjo, Chris Martin, Bono]
But say a prayer, and pray for the other ones
At Christmastime, it’s hard but while you’re having fun
There’s a world outside your window, and it’s a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you

[Verse 3: Seal, Ellie Goulding, Sinead O'Connor, Bono]
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there's no hope tonight
Where to comfort is to fear
Why is touch is to be scared
How can they know it’s Christmastime at all

Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy
I got telepathy, I got the recipe
I got the streets and I don’t got no felonies
Forward thinking, yeah my mind is ahead of me
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me
What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that Marvin and Chardonnay
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy
That bitch airplane mode, cold
No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny
Penthouse, birds eye view, that's a nest for me
I got my self out of debt
So when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need

I don't wanna love nobody but you

Got no regrets 'cause it got me here

Swam all across the ocean blue

Carolyn Dawn Johnson,So Complicated,59,non-hit,"Lyrics[]I'm so scared that the way that I feel
Is written all over my face
When you walk into the room
I want to find a hiding place
We used to laugh, we used to hug,
The way that all friends do
But now I smile at a touch of your hand
Just makes me come unglued,
Such a contradiction,
Do I lie or tell the truth,
Is it fact or fiction,
Oh the way I feel for you
It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated
I want to hold you close
I want to push you away
I want to make you go
I want to make you stay
Should I say it
Should I tell you how I feel
Oh I want you to know
But then again I don't
So complicated.
Oh, just when I think I'm under control
I think I've finally got a grip.
Another friend tells me that
My name is always on your lips.
They say I'm more then Just a friend,
They say I must be blind.
I admit that I've seen you watch
But from the corner of your eye
Oh it's so confusing
Yeah I wish you'd just confess..
But think of what I'd be losing
If your answer wasn't yes.
It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated
I want to hold you close
I want to push you away
I want to make you go
I want to make you stay
Should I say it
Should I tell you how I feel
Oh I want you to know
But then again I don't
So complicated.
I hate it, 'cause I've waited
So long for someone like you.

Oh should I say it? should I tell you how I feel, oh I want to you know, but Then again I don't.

So I'm gonna let it do all the talking

I felt a little fear, upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking

Said, Hey there lady, will you marry me?

So I stopped it dead for a beat or two

But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that
And it won't forgive me after all these years

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by, they can see the gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, Hold up
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip and my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' to bone, ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol, and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up until the maximum
I can speak for some niggas tryin' to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak (oak)
Music loud and tippin' slow (slow)
Twin's steady twistin' like, Hit this though
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, Who is that producing?
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston, but I'm still ain't losin'

Just swerved, all up in the curve and
Nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on the blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce on my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the low key
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like, Fuck 'em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg

Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rear-view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin' (keep tryin')

Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (tags)
Pull me over try to check my slab (slab)
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about 'em not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tell 'em, We hate you
I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home, and it's on

Roll my eyes

And when she on the molly she a zombie

She think we Clyde and Bonnie, but it's more like Whitney Bobby

God, forgive me

Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend

Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence

Dr. Dre Featuring Snoop Dogg,Still D.R.E.,93,non-hit,"Lyrics[] Yeah, nigga
I'm still fucking with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back?
Still, doing that shit Andre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
Since the last time you heard from me, I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali' weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
So if you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

Nine-five plus four pennies, add that shit up

I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing

You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it

Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?

Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'

Eminem Featuring Dido,Stan,51,non-hit,"Lyrics[Intro: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too


[Chorus: Dido]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!


[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was come sunlight, scram,  now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit (Fuck!)
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

Been a lover, been a cheat

Used to be your Romeo, but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still, it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope
Would be dope, but
What kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you die for sticks a steak knife in your heart
Do you try more?
Another late night in
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers to plant the K-Y in
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and
Who has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch, it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in

When you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows

Got that boob job for him

After you, I swore To make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like when
You get a pay hike, and, am I the good guy, or
Do I just play like him and hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream Fuck you
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snakes eyes in

You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
Can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy

I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me

ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks, and I'm fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about
An evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me, I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater

Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers
What goes around, comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack
Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink
Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake!)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretendin' to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera
'Cause my lyrics never sit well, so they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry
Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em, I'm dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliteratin' everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon
Who went in me, and be on the receiving of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl
I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a-, man, stop

Eminem Featuring Rihanna,The Monster,1,hit,"Lyrics[]I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me (what up?)
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)

Sometimes, you gotta come back down (it's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (yeah)
Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, Fuck it
Pile the carnage up 'til its so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (what?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them
A God but a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (what?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear old dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only gut you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say I hate you to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade up, and then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil
I'm leaving Heaven (yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (you know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (you know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (or maybe I should say, Thank you)
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)
So you better, you better run (yeah)
You better, you better run (so I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)

We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why

The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
They see that low rider go by, they're like, Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey, like, Sick 'em, Dre!
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, Move, a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

We'll come through the side

Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got ya hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down

'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back
… Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
… Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', wining and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

(Get it crunk, crunk! Crunk! Crunk!)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
… The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we just going off popular consensus
… But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'
… So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (Bump, bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
… 'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
… Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That's why we came to...

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know

And plenty honey's involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
Let's rally, hands up for the grand finale

Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers

(One Love, One Love)
When I saw you
It stopped
My heart stopped beating
I want us to be alone
For you, I'm out of control
Forgive me, my love
For this invitation

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Let’s go to the bathroom
Where nobody can see
If you do not know me, we'll get to know each other
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
To spend one more day like this, I can’t stand it

Let’s go to the moon, let’s go to the movies
Let’s give each other a kiss that never ends
If you want something serious, we’ll see tomorrow
If we’re a couple, or just friends

[Bridge: Enrique Iglesias]
Ooh, uoh, uoh
If we are a couple
Or we are friends
Keep calm, we’ll see tomorrow

If I see you again
It will stop again
My breath, to see you dance
If you know that you like me, why do you act crazy
When I look at you, you bite your mouth
I just want to see you dance with no clothes
On the same bed, same note

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Let’s go to the bathroom
Where nobody can see
If you do not know me, we'll get to know each other
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
To spend one more day like this, I can’t stand it

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
(Yeeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
Have fun coz life is going fast
Like your ex, who was early precocious
With you I always make more than two
You heat up on your own, no need to use defrost
Calm down, little by little you get to know me
For now, I want to see you in all poses
If you let me wash you inside the closet
You’re already hot and it’s still not twelve, yeh
Have fun coz life is only one
And my heart stops, makes you a lagoon
Call me after one, Saint by day, devil when the moon falls, yeeh

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Let’s go to the bathroom
Where nobody can see
If you do not know me, we'll get to know each other
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
To spend one more day like this, I can’t stand it
Let’s go to the moon, let’s go to the movies

She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, Oh, good Lord, she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you're a song

We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'

Because I'd rather take the fast route
If you wanna open up bets then I'm open up TD
She like papi all I got is CD

Man down
Throw the piece to my bro, that's a hand down
Help him shoot on the lot, make him camp down
He was talkin' back then, he a fan now

Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss or a plug

Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up

Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time

Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink

My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendy's

From the crap tables down in A.C.
Back on the block, Jay-Z motherfucker from the, the, the Roc
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same
Brooklyn be the place where I serve them thangs
See my niggas was strugglin', 'til they birds they came
And then we got to hustlin', murderin' thangs
I dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain
Now I'm Titanic, Iceberg's the name
Leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game
The best way to describe me in a word, insane
I dick down chicks all emerged in my fame
Jigga been dope since Slick Rick's first chain
The God, send you back to the earth from which you came
I'm bakin' soda, water, fire, merged with 'caine
Ladies don't know me said, I heard he's vain
Well guess what mami? I heard the same
You heard the name

I got a license to kill so I steer the gat
Roc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, niggas scared of that
Got a new motto this year, Don't fuck with my ones
Knock on your door, three in the mornin'
It's just us and the guns!
See I scramble with priests, hustle with nuns
I got the mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy
Niggas get fly, let 'em defy gravity
Fo'-five rapidly lift your chest cavity
Streets won't let me chill
Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill
Muh'fuckers want to wet me still, I remain y'all
Raw, the one, like five divided by four (uh)
Shit, this just the hate that's been provided by y'all
Reciprocated and multiplied by more

Drop-top Bentley Azure, holla at me ya'll (uh)

I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should
'Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood
They all black in the club, the outcome ain't good
Them niggas act like wolves, how come? They could
'Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs and smash
'Til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn, they glad
Let 'em sit up in they whip 'til I launch it back
Snap they neck, then shoot 'em to they aunts and back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that

The kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Uh, we gon' reach a billi' first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused

And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new

But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
(Mmm) pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things
Hundred percent, Black-owned champagne

My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal in, yeah
Kept the trey on me like Chris Paulin'
Drinkin' Ace of Spade like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see a sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer
Smile
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it's a blessin'

Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin'
A nigga up in the hundreds of millions
I have no ceilings, ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's You Bring Me Joy
Slappin' out of the toy, the separation is clear
In my rear-view mirror, objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair
Playin' for high stakes
Norman Cake, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
Chargin' my own fate
Respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours
Niggas only own houses
Ours was, Fuck you, pay me
Now it's, Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue
That blood money, I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Paris
All y'all jewelers should be embarrassed, huh
Blood diamonds drippin', we cute
I still ain't trippin', that's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America like me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, Prehaps I Freudian slipped in European whips
God sent me to break the chain
I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do?
'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line
And too old, these that drugs
Heroin flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian
Don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed?
I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Fear for you, bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado
Yeah, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the project 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Jason Aldean With Luke Bryan & Eric Church,The Only Way I Know,40,hit,"Lyrics[]Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that's how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Don't quit 'til the job gets done
That's the only way I know
Don't stop 'til everything's gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know
That old red dirt, the first thing you learn
Is you don't get nothing that you don't earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
We didn't know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn't thinking 'bout nothing but winning
That's the only way I know
Don't stop 'til everything's gone

Don't back up, don't back down

Will get you there a little bit faster,

But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?

Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy

We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh

[Verse 1: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown]
If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Tell me how you're gon' be without me

This is a man's world

To take us over the road
Man made the train

Man made electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man think about a little bitty
Baby girl and a baby boy
Man makes then happy
'Cause man makes them toys

And after man has made everything, everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

But this is a man, man's, man's world

Don't think that I'll be a saint

Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake

Baby, I can't explain

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)

Kanye West Featuring Cam'ron & Consequence,Gone,18,hit,"Lyrics[]Wished I had told, was the only one (uh-oh)
But it's too late, it's too late
She's gone
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay! Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way
Too late, we gone, we strivin' home
Gone, I ride on chrome
It's too late
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin' on the Usher tour he had to Let it Burn
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin' over babysitters like, Bitch, it's yo' turn!
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
Are-are-are-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone
We strivin' home, gone
I ride on chrome
We strivin' home, gone
Killa, I ride on chrome
Knock knock, who's there
Killa Cam, Killa who
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal ma we goin' to the dealer
No concealin', no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggas still doin' puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just goin' tell 'em (Too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (Gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you want to see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin' like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin' my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin' alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now
We strivin' home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that
Cause
I been pourin' out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin' to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda' gone wrong
Now they askin' Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta' gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin' money mighta' gone to the feds
So I ain't goin' to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin' he was gone with my bread
And with that bein' said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin' back now shoulda' gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind,  cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone
I'm
Ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me want to get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin' it all behind
Kanye step away from the limelight, like, when I was on the grind
In the One, Nine, Nine, Nine
Before, model chicks was bendin' over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen year old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirror
How we out in Europe, spendin' Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'mma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin' the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorty's at the door 'cause they need more

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage

There was no doubt
That hatred pulls you in
And love pulls you out
If you believe in faith, you will never fall
Love will take you higher than any wall

Just believe (Love will always set you free)
If you just believe
Only love can set you free
Love will be everything you need
A little faith, charity
If you just believe
Open up, let it in
It will change everything, really
Love is life, love is free
If you only just believe
Only love can set you free
Love is free, let it be
A little faith, charity

Misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
Sex
She just wanna close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls, say hey (hey)
Say hey (hey), (ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (play)
She plays, only when you tell her no
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush

I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny, accept it, your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper

When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your weight, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House

Hit the prez with a Cuban link on my neck

Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (that's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, Fuck your haters
I can see the baller in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby, count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes

Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list

Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphing on what the lord had done
He said, K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
I can't sugar coat the answer for you
This is how I feel—if somebody kill my son
That mean somebody's gettin' killed
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap

Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours

Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother

Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
And promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin'ìg or you married to blood?
I'll ask again—oops—accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

Kenny Rogers With Alison Krauss & Billy Dean,Buy Me A Rose,40,hit,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life
Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life
And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he hold inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of you and me
So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
Opened the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right

Kevin Gates Featuring August Alsina,I Don't Get Tired (#IDGT),90,non-hit,"Lyrics[]I was tryna get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I wanna pull up, head spin
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
Full time father, full time artist
Asked God, he said Grind a little harder
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
Iron sharpens, you the dagger
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Rap game, I'm a pallbearer
Kill me and get a call after
First look, it was all laughter
Kevin Gates, no small matter
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Dive in the crowd, no safety harness
Gun in the booth, no safety on it
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
I was tryna get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I wanna pull up, head spin
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
Me and the woman I love on an air mattress
We share a cot, my hair nappy
Couldn't afford flights, no air travel
Stale Rice Krispies like sand and gravel
Our testament to what can happen
The moment you follow your heart
Keeping the faith even when it get dark
They say give up as I tell them Get lost
Six weeks ago I just purchased a foreign
Most likely the one that you cannot afford
Right foot on the gas
Balenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash
Chick that I'm with
Shorty be doing her shit and it's okay to say that she bad
Look to the right and I give her a glance
Pray to God we don't, pray to God we don't crash
I was tryna get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I wanna pull up, head spin
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard

Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feud, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

But I know I won't be home, and you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?

I was goin' through that phase alone
We all change, you say I changed alone
Sleepless nights, barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong

Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy, know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio, but I'm Chicago's Jay-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe today, was looking crazy
Money ran low, right? Felons can't vote, right?
I can't even vote for who I believe in, shit ain't goin' right
I just dropped a tear inside the funeral, I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site

Throw it in they face every time I hold it up

Shootout with the police, I ain't goin' to jail
How he actin' off a case, you'll know if he tell
I know a nigga from the hood, he'll serve with no scale

Gave 'em thirty-nine years, I heard him cry in the cell

Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like I'll be out tomorrow
Keep the Glock on 'em

With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the fountain of youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads Don't cry, stay tuned
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

Conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like dun-dun-dun-dun
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
It's suicide or it's do or die
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself It's just you and I
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I'll give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry), I fuckin' love you
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)

I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulder
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you

I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down

I been at it with my homies
It don't matter, you don't know me
I been rolling with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been busting, no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

I torture you

I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear sh! t but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fvcking complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fvck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you

And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it

And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know you're the reason I believe in life

And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life

Alright, okay
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope-nope, y'all can't copy
Yeah, bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said...
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

I see her dancing on a fool

She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty

Martin Garrix x Troye Sivan,There For You,94,non-hit,"Lyrics[] I woke up pissed off today
And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too
Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you
I got you, I promise
But let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too
Boy, I'm holdin' onto something
Won't let go of you for nothing

Gettin' all of my attention
Could this be love at first sight, baby
You walked away and I missed you
Visions of wanting to kiss you
How could this be if I don't really know you?
Ohh baby, baby
Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?
You had on the latest fashion
It was a bigger distraction
It drew me closer and closer to you, yeah, baby
I never saw anything like this
But you I just could not resist
I swallowed my pride and stepped through your side
Or could it be - be
Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?

And maybe somebody we just might hook up, could this love at first sight?

Tell 'em what's the 411 and who came runnin'

And if you take a look at my life, no more drama

Miranda Lambert Duet With Carrie Underwood,Somethin' Bad,19,hit,"Lyrics[] Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clappin'
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen
Pulled up to the church, but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down the window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm headed to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clappin'
I got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen
The drinks keep comin', throw my head back laughin'
Wake up in the mornin', don't know what happened
Whoa, somethin' bad
Whoa, somethin' bad
Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen
'Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnappin'

Pray for better days, now it's 300k when my day ends

NF Featuring Hopsin,Lost,79,non-hit,"Lyrics[] Look
Self-awareness, pride's a coat, and yes, I like to wear it
Buttoned up, don't like to let no air in
With a pair of gloves that I hope doesn't perish
I discovered, though, when I get holes in them
And I let joy in, I'm in higher spirits
My mistakes are like a screamin' parrot
Just repeating lyrics, I can barely bear it when I'm lost
Road is narrow, I'm lookin' down it like a gun's barrel
Aren't we all searchin' for the serum
That could help us breathe and leave our state of peril?
All of us have made defensive scarecrows
That we scatter 'round our fields and treat like heroes
When they scare away the things that we should cherish
'Cause we're too embarrassed to admit the fear is that we're lost
Yeah, but what does it matter? I get so combative
Inside of me's a personal canvas, the paint can be splattered
Get messy when I start to get rattled
The heart of a savage, I'm quiet when I lurk in the shadows
But somethin' don't add up, I don't wanna be overdramatic
But look at the data, it's obvious that humans are fragile
We tend to get mad at the ones that call us out
But the fact is we need someone that'll be honest when we fly off the handle
I admit I throw a fit when I begin to unravel
Keep my wits, been off the grid but now I'm back in the saddle
My intent is not to rent, I like to own what I value
I could sit here on the fence or maybe pick up the paddle
I like to row against the current, that's the way that I travel
Opposite of what the grain does, got the brain of a rebel
Take initiative, I'm diligent on every level
I never could settle, I like to keep my foot on the pedal, yeah
I'd love to pack arenas and all
But what I really wanna do is learn to handle my thoughts
And put the reins on 'em, show 'em I'm the one that's the boss
And pull 'em back when they get out of hand, I'm breakin' they jaws
I'm takin' the flaws that told me I could never evolve
Then pull a Bane on 'em, ask 'em, Oh, you think you're in charge?
You oughta know better, ain't no way around it, I'm flawed
The traits that I want, they say I can't afford what it cost
But I (I), manifested this
Failing's how you grow and learn your lessons, kids
Take the worst and try to make the best of it
'Cause when you fail, just know that it's a test and if
You can learn to pick yourself back up again
And train your brain to not be such a pessimist
It's okay to make mistakes, just don't forget that
There's a high road but I skip the exit when I'm lost
Yeah
When I'm lost
When I'm lost (lost)
When I'm lost
When I'm lost (lost), lost
Wow, these burdens are heavy
And I'm hopin' it don't bury me
I used to be joyful and skip so merrily
But now I'm too cautious and tip toe carefully
My mind left and it's nowhere to be found
Am I a big old parody?
'Cause it's no fair to me
And now I'm at the point where I'm spending a grand a week on hypnotherapy
Look, I'm tryna wash away my sins
I got a group of loved ones that ain't my friends
And if I ever take an L, then they might grin
And they all wanna see me stay in the cage I'm in
So when it comes to anybody, there's no trust for no one
Man, so what? My whole plan's to go nuts
My shoulders ready for more shrugs, I'm gon' judge
Anybody tryna enter my circle with no love (hold up)
My sanity's gone, I'd rather be torn from this planet they planted me on
Yes, that's a reward, I'm actually bored with having a sore heart
It's torn apart from a family that I don't have anymore (now hol' up)
I was livin' so oblivious with millions, it really was a pity, huh? (A pity, huh?)
It's kinda funny what a penny does, mixed in with a mini buzz (I feel stuck)
Life's got me by the neck, with a blade against it (what?)
'Cause I was runnin' late for the train and missed it (what?)
The only thing I feel is pain and vengeance (what?)
So I'ma act out like a raging misfit (what?)
And every verse I lay gon' stay sadistic (yeah)
You wanna hate me? Good, great, terrific (good)
You'll never see the day where my anger's dismissed
You better go and change your wishlist 'cause I
Yeah, manifested this
Do not treat me like some adolescent kid
I am praying to the Lord with the book of James
Hopin' he gon' add my testament
This dark cloud, that's my residence
Demons knockin', I don't have to let 'em in
I done made mistakes, day to day, you probably can't relate

Nas Featuring Kanye West,Cop Shot The Kid,96,non-hit,"Lyrics[] The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, Ree, put your hands up, black boy!

I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high

Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why is that?

'Cuz we love to talk on ass we gettin'
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I they like me in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that we not takin' it lightly

From plain facials to Botox and face lifts

Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector (hot shit) so feel me when I bring it

Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous above the law

And the brightness of day, I like the dark
And I think to my self

Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Singing, How do you do?

One hot video, you hyped? Now you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named Jay, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, oh, you Nas, bae?
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat and tears in perfecting my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (Oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also
Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle (Oh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia
I told her, Bitch, now, just hold up!
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis

You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I want to accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Ay yo, I came in the door, I said it before
I never the ladiez hypnotize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bouswar
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

That'll change my linen after I done blazed and hit 'em
But I just wanna rock wit' you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible, cause I ain't trying to stop you boo

One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it, girl

The pack in the post and I'm home alone

They turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
If you reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Give a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga, I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he fold, and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know your bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy your bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck her on the camera, we can call it even

Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me

Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets

Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal
Time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker
Turn me up some
Yo
Oh shit, who those motherfuckers coming in here?
No, it can't be (Yo)

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo, give me some room, I'm throwing elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm making the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I can't help it if the club only packin' a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down at three
And you ballin' ass niggas, who's dressed to kill
For the hoes showing the toes with extra heels (Man)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch

Yo, security patting my legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be (Stay down)
All my niggas in the huddle, on the count of three
We gonna bum rush the tunnel with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazing like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm acting a fool
Like a three o'clock bully waiting after school (Punks)
I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash, smoke, drink
Shake that ass thang, the fuck you think?
Papa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pouring
Since Def is the label I belong in a morgue
I'm walking half dead, acting senile
With bigger niggas from jail than the one on Green Mile
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed uptown

Yeah, that's right, we up in this joint now
Ayo, we getting ready to take over
Freddie, you grab the mic, I'ma grab the turntables

Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you drunk up in the V.I.P. (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you swingin' from them club nights (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you like to start them club fights (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
Everybody wave your hands now (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down (Let's get dirty, come on)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody come to wild out (Let's get dirty, wild out)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you a big dog no doubt (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
Everybody wave your hands now (Let's get dirty, put 'em up)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down (Let's get dirty, come on)

Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)

… Uh oh
It ain't my fault (did I do that?)
It ain't my fault (did I do that?)
It ain't my fault (did I do that?)
… That's right my meat and potatoes come from my lyrical label
I throw my rhymes for No Limit like Jeff George throw for the Raiders
Don't cut the head off a hater, don't cash the check that they paid ya
Jump in a Deville or Mercedes, Lexus or Navigator
Five hundred niggas talkin' 'bout what they gon' do, how they gon' ruin my day
Not none of them niggas be talkin' like that when they come 'round the way
Hold your mouth as tight as you can, whatever you don't loosen your lip
I make your tightest hardest rapper brush his teeth with my dick
I'm strict, I'm rich, I'm young, I'm black, I'm set
I got it, I hold it, I run it, I do it to death
I'm hot, I'm dirty, I'm oiled, I'm strapped, I'm done
Don't blame it on me if the police find a pistol and blunt

You talk about goin' to war, if you knowin' you can't win
We'll make our money make cash, with no gimmicks
I ride the tank and my back reads, No Limit
Mister rowdy rowdy, write a book about it
Every rhyme, all the time you make a hook about it
Money I count it, but it ain't enough
Heard I had chicks around me, chicks I can't touch
Since I have niggas around me that ain't gon' bust
If you ever see like that you know them niggas ain't with us
It ain't my fault if my name spell cash
It ain't my fault if your girl got my name tattooed on her ass
It ain't my fault if your concert can't sell out half the show
It ain't my fault if you do twice as much as me and I get half the dough
Y'all saw me style, change my flow
Bad money, good money, change my dough
I can't be bought, can't be bought, I didn't do it ain't my fault

Call me Kobе, 24 on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, that lil' bitch, she do the most

I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll

I like the way he's speaking

His confidence is peaking

Don't like his baggy jeans

But I'ma like what's underneath it

And no I ain't been to MIA

I heard that Cali never rains

And New York's heart awaits

First let's see the West End

I'll show you to my brethren

Dress in all your fancy clothes

But I still talk that caaaash

Cuz a lot wags wanna hear it

I just need some dick, I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas, baby
I just need a thug
Won't you be my plug? Ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake, baby
I'ma need more than a hug

Your nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way
Trust me, it's all okay, trust me, it's all

Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke
White wine, weed smoke
That's my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late-night attention, uncondition
All that you're missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldn't even have to justify
I get it, I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do what's best for your mind
How 'bout I just take my time?
You call up my line, I fall up inside you

I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole

Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips

I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us
This time, I'm ready

Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing

Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home

But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering, Where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry-go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me?
Do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

In the tree line, by the gold clock?
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway with a big cake?
Happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?
A universe away

Of Destiny child,

Of Destiny child,
More precious than a diamond on a platinum chain!

When he was buskin he was all the rage.
He met Jables and he taught him well,
All the techniques that were developed in hell.
Cock pushups and the power slide,
Gig simulation now theres nowhere to hide.
They formed a band they named Tenacious D,
And then they got the Pick of Destiny.
Cause it's the Pick!

You know where we'll be rockin' cause it's fucking insane!
It's just the Pick!

Our tasty grooves are better than a chicken chow mein!
Cause he who is sleazy,
Is easy to pleasy.
And she who is juicy,
Must be loosy-goosey.
And he who is groovy,
Will be in my movie,
So come on!
The wizard and the demon had a battle royale,
The demon almost killed him with an evil kapow,
But then he broke his tooth and thus the demon said OW
Cause it's the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
You know where we'll be rockin' cause it's fucking insane!
It's just the Pick!
Of Destiny child,
You know our movie's better than Citizen Kane!
Cause he who's a geezer,
Must live in my freezer.
And she who is starkey,
Is full of mularkey.
And he who is groovy,
Must be in my movie,
So come on!
Oh! Cause if you're a diva,
Then go to Geneva.
And if you're a crony,
Then suck on my bone.
And if you are groovy,
Then get in my movie!
It's called the Pick of Destiny!

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you have to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
With your heart like I was the pre-da-tor
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things
And I lie and I lie
And I lie and I lie

I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

The Dirty Heads Featuring Rome,Lay Me Down,93,non-hit,"Lyrics[] Well this is how it starts, Two lovers in the dark
On the run, from the one That they called Sheriff Spark
Six guns by their side and bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase
The safe was nearly empty and They were nearly free
But were seen by the Good eye of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs They're on the run
It's the two outsiders Grab your horses and your guns
I said I wish that
We could stay here,
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun
We gotta pack our bags this instant,
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we all arrive there so safely,
Baby you can
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Well it's the story of the two
Always on the move
They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds
Now they're crossing borders
Sheriffs posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell
They drank up all the whiskey and They partied every night
Like it could be the last The bounty said shoot on sight
So they chased the endless summer Though it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running till They found a paradise
But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead
They were finally free To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said
I said I think that we can stay here,
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant,
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely,
Baby you can
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Well you're my green-eyed girl And I've been running around with you
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do
So wipe the dirt off, or Take your shirt off,
And we should go hit the cantina, We got work off
I said it's hot outside Let me go swimming in your eyes
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down and make smile
I could never ask for nothing better than this
It's just tequila and the beach, that's why its salty when we kiss
I said I think that we can stay here,
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun

Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town

A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus

Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?

Just walk around the crib like

Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me, while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit

As long as there's kindness down the line

Got enough faith to get us home

The Lonely Island,J**z In My Pants,72,non-hit,"Lyrics[] Lock eyes from across the room
Down my drink while the rhythms boom
Take your hand and skip the names
No need here for the silly games
Make our way through the smoke and crowd
The club is the sky, and I'm on your cloud
Move in close as the lasers fly
Our bodies touch and the angels cry
Leave this place, go back to yours
Our lips first touch outside your doors
A whole night, what we've got in store
Whisper in my ear that you want some more
And I
Jizz in my pants
This really never happens, you can take my word
I won't apologize, that's just absurd
Mainly your fault for the way that you dance
And now I
Jizz in my pants
Don't tell your friends, or I'll say you're a slut
Plus it's your fault, you were rubbing my butt
I'm very sensitive, some would say that's a plus
Now I'll go home and change
I need a few things from the grocery
Do things alone now mostly
Left me heartbroken not lookin' for love
Surprise in my eyes when I looked above
The checkout counter and I saw her face
My heart stood still, so did time and space
Never felt that I could feel real again
But the look in her eyes said, I need a friend
She turned to me, that's when she said it
Looked me dead in the face, asked, Cash or credit?
And I
Jizzed in my pants
It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me
But we're going to need a cleanup on aisle three
And now I'm posed in an awkward stance
Because I jizzed in my pants
To be fair, you were flirting a lot
Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot
Please, stop acting like you're not impressed
One more thing, I'm gonna pay by check
Last week, I saw a film
As I recall, it was a horror film
Walked outside into the rain
Checked my phone and saw you rang and I
Jizzed in my pants
Speeding down the street when the red lights flash
Need to get away, need to make a dash
A song comes on that reminds me of you and I
Jizz in my pants
The next day, my alarm goes off and I
Jizz in my pants
Open my window and a breeze rolls in and I
Jizz in my pants
When Bruce Willis was dead at the end of Sixth Sense I
Jizzed in my pants
I just ate a grape and I
Jizzed in my pants
I went to check-
Jizzed in my pants
Okay, seriously you guys, can we, okay?
I jizz right in my pants every time you're next to me
And when we're holding hands, it's like having sex to me
You say I'm premature, I just call it ecstasy
I wear a rubber at all times, it's a necessity

I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever son me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life

We are the VA players
Love to the Neptunes and the Clipse
To ya bootleggers we breaking off both of ya legs
The underrated Maganoo, comin' with the unexpected
The run away slave I, Misdemeanor
Escaping from all ya fraudulent players
Last but not least, the heavyweight champion, Mr. Mosley

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without some little nieces and nephews
To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through
Time's up, sorry I left you
Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits
Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit (Shit)
As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tune
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Jump when you hear them speakers left it off (Off)
Mr. VA 'bout to set it off
Well I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what ya know
Well my folks done told me (YOU GOT IT!)
So, Up Jumps the Boogie, let the record work (Uh huh)
And put me on like you Red Alert
Cause it's the big bad Timmy, Maganoo, and Missy

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes into my head as just chit-chatter
You may think I'm egotistical or just worry free
Won'tcha say I go tell it to, TIMOTHY!
People say I'm whack, but they don't tell me so
Let them pretend to be me, then they know
I hate when one, pretend to fantasize
Fact I despise, those who even try
Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking
Yo dream is over, career sinking
I told all of you, like I told all of them
Whatcha say to me be, DICK TO YA CHIN!

Vanessa Anne Hudgens,When There Was Me And You,72,non-hit,"Lyrics[] … It's funny when you find yourself
Looking from the outside
I'm standing here but all I want
Is to be over there
Why did I let myself believe
Miracles could happen?
'Cause now I have to pretend
That I don't really care
… I thought you were my fairy tale
A dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star
That's coming true
But everybody else could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
When there was me and you
… I swore I knew the melody
That I heard you singing
And when you smiled
You made me feel
Like I could sing along
But then you went and changed the words
Now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be's
And once upon a song
… Now I know you're not a fairy tale
And dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star
Just don't come true
'Cause now even I can tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
Because I liked the view
When there was me and you
… I can't believe
That I could be so blind
It's like you were floating
While I was falling
And I didn't mind

I thought you felt it too

Vicci Martinez,Dog Days Are Over,68,non-hit,"Lyrics[] Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble
She sank with her drink
And washed it away
Down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over, done
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over, done
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
And I never wanted anything from you, except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh, happiness hit her like a bullet
In the head struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

Wham! Featuring George Michael,Careless Whisper,1,hit,"Lyrics[] I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad good-byes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend (should've known better, yeah)
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh
Never without your love
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

I keep a razor blade tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (Yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (Bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (No)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya

I took it off track, now I'm ridin' in sport (yeah)
You stay in your feelings, you never my boy
I can't come to the hood, I pull a decoy
Another body drop, and they screamin' my name
I'm goin' to L.A. On a private plane
Could never come back and my family straight (grrah)
I'm touchable? No, I'm too rich and too paid
Skeleton Cartier, black diamonds spade
Pull up too deep like a fuckin' parade
Old jealous-ass niggas try and fuck up my pay (ha)

This drip out the trenches, I know you gon' dig it, I come through this motherfucker plain (whoa)

She lovin' the fest', I see it
She lovin' the fest' (straight up, straight up)
Yeah, I see it on her face, and I'm lovin' that body in lace
And I love you lil' Spider and Drake

I don't know if I wanna caress you
Wonder what I wanna do with you, girl
Don't know what I wanna would do with you

Pussy nigga usually pop a trigger if the hand speak
Lackluster, I'ma smack suckers this year
I'ma make a hunnid thousand racks off of this shit
Do the math, hunnid million for the slow ones in the class
Type of bags I be gettin' be too big to pay in cash
Send it wide, send it fast, 'fore I might just change my mind

When you broke, you doin' more for less
You ain't findin' no success

Listen
I gotta say what's on my mind
Something about us
Doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try, somehow the plan
Is always rearranged
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've go to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now, I gotta go my own way
(Own way)
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up
And I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leaving today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now, I gotta go my own way
What about us?
What about everything we've been through?
What about trust?
You know I never wanted to hurt you
And what about me?
What am I supposed to do?
I gotta leave but I'll miss you
So, I've got to move on and be who I am
(Why do you have to go?)
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now (I want you to stay)
I wanna go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am
(What about us?)
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find a place in this world someday

Zac Efron & Vanessa Hudgens,Can I Have This Dance,98,non-hit,"Lyrics[] Take my hand, take a breath
Pull me close and take one step
Keep your eyes locked on mine,
And let the music be your guide.
Won't you promise me (now won't you promise me, that you'll never forget)
We'll keep dancing (to keep dancing) wherever we go next
It's like catching lightning the chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together, we just keep on getting better
So can I have this dance (can I have this dance)
Can I have this dance
Take my hand, I'll take the lead
And every turn will be safe with me
Don't be afraid, afraid to fall
You know I'll catch you threw it all
And you can't keep us apart (even a thousand miles, can't keep us apart)
'Cause my heart is (cause my heart is) wherever you are
It's like catching lightning the chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together, we just keep on getting better
So can I have this dance (can I have this dance)
Can I have this dance
Oh no mountains too high enough, oceans too wide
'Cause together or not, our dance won't stop
Let it rain, let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for
You know I believe, that we were meant to be
It's like catching lightning the chances of finding someone like you (like you)
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do (way we do)
And with every step together, we just keep on getting better
So can I have this dance (can I have this dance)
Can I have this dance
Can I have this dance

There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
So we're breaking free

Creating space between us

Zayn / Taylor Swift,I Don't Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker),2,hit,"Lyrics[] Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life
Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
All night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
