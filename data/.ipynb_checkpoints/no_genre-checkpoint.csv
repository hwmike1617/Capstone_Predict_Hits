Been shitting up bricks, unload 'em to Gussy (Cuff 'em up, light 'em up, bitch)
Boss of the ghetto with the round-shape cookie
Shit one, throw one, nigga, flood the block
If I don't go to jail, nigga, birds gon' flock (Brrr! Brrr!)
Nigga sitting on the toilet, bitch, get off the pot!
The bird just landed so the hood gonna rock
New whips, big chips, the Prada-Gucci shit
Bought mami a fly Benz, the wide, skinny lips
She takes my flight, she holds my weight
While the Port was staked out from state to state
It ain't nothing to a baller, baby
Pay the cost, big money, heavyweight, Birdman, hood boss, baby
Stepping on my line, I'll show a little something
Make Corleone come out and the black crow'll touch you

Uugh! Another soul lost
Had to make his shirt match my oxblood-colored Porsche
Uugh! The rims match, of course
Blood hit his Timbs, it reminded me of them
Glistening, wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm, a gorgeous killer
I put this on my Lord:
My niece was four when she felt chinchilla
I passed the chauffeur that shit
That made fiends rise from the dead like ""Thriller""
Gangster, hustler
At night, still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreaming, kick my feet up
Gun poked my waist, remind me of my demon, so
Quit your yappin' before I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix-and-matchin', fella

When you say them
What are words
If they're only for good times
Then they're done

When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud
Those words, They never go away
They live on, even when we're gone

Anywhere you are, I am near
Anywhere you go, I'll be there
And I'm gonna be here forever more

Every single promise I'll keep

In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose

I'm faded, flat busted
Been jaded, I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

Found another goat I try to put the blame on
And now I'm stepping on all the cracks, so I guess there ain't no use

City High,What Would You Do?,8,hit,"[Verse 1: Robby]
Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five or six strippers tryna work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

[Chorus: Claudette & Robby]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry?
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life
Mmm

[Verse 2: Ryan Toby]
Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be livin' all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die
She said, ""[Nigga], I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more [shit] that you can't even relate to""

You say your having a baby
But I don't know if it's mine

It wasn't part of the plan
But now I see you got an attitude
And you're so confused
You didn't tell me 'bout your man at home
So what you gonna do?

Chillin' in the club on a Saturday night
Saw you across the floor you were looking so fly
I can't believe that you were also looking my way
Yes you were, yes you were
So I stepped to you with my game down tight
Before we knew it, it was on for tonight
So now tell me what's goin' on with you lady

[Bridge: J-Shin]
So tell me what's going on
Please don't make me wait
I know you're living with your man
Sleeping with your man
Creepin' with your friends
Saying you wanna get with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: LaTocha]
Now boy you know just as well as I do
In order to go half on a baby, it takes two
Yes it does, yes it does, yes it does
And even though I had a man at home
All we ever did was fuss and fight
Things just wasn't right
Sick and tired of being mistreated
Neglected for no reason
When love was all I needed
He didn't care, so I cheated

But in the grand scheme what do we got?
What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us
We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
We cut through the divide and we do it with pride
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
Cause change is what they've been afraid of
Their malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate
Celebrate, elevate, love, love
(Love make the world go round)
[Interlude: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Jennifer Lopez)]
Cannot be killed or swept aside
(Love make the world go round)
And fill the world with music, love and pride
(Love make the world go round
Love make the world go round)
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top

I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes

I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama

I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you're movin'
I know when you in the house or when you're cruisin' (That's right)

And I can't understand how a man got you choosin' (Yeah)

My undivided, you came and denied it (Why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin' (I know when you lyin')
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin' (Stop cryin')
I'm not applyin' no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese (C'mon), put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies (That's right)
Now it's time you invest in me
'Cause if not, then it's best you leave
Holla, yeah

And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Sometimes Mrs. Rudy calls cryin' late at night
'Cause her and Mr. Ugly have had another fight
We talk a while, and I hear her smile
When she says thank you, I tell her that she's welcome

But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin'

Niggas never learnin' that they eyes keep lurkin'
Have ya janitor pumpin' your X5 murkin'
Skid marks the street, your heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga overcook that meat
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that cause forever I be needin' 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin' 'em
Some love, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin' 'em

Fiends are rushin' when the mack blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink watch how quick life pass you

I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I’m all alone
But I am, I'm nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feeling low she feeling sad
I would take credit for what’s wrong
But I am nothing without love

[Verse 1]
Three years at sea after the storm
On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I, I got nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
Now here you show up with the force of a wave
And so I'm setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state
Hey hey, I don’t want to lose this one, she make me feel whole
You know, I am nothing without love

[Bridge]
Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Come on slide up right here by my side
You know that I, I want to rest in your light

Yeah, you gon' remember me, boo, I'm gonna remember you too

You was doing too much, I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying, you got a man anyway
I can't explain it neither, I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see you
When I see you, I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on before I could say

[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection

I was riding in my car one day (oh)
In the express lane rolling down the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt, on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now
The doctor said I don't think he's gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day

Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening
Cause its been so hard for me month to month
Struggling to eat but still there was no answer (no answer)
I stopped believing in His word and got so mad at Him
When somebody say Gods good I just laugh at them (oh yeah)

With a gun at my waist and for people had no love
See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone
Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me
I was shot four times and before I knew it I was on my knees
(Blood gushing out my body my hearts beatin' fast
I don't know what I'm a do I don't think I'm gonna last)
Then I began to flashback on the thing I've done in my past

(Too late to talk about it)

[Verse 2]
Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love

Running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

If you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays

'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
Mama taught me a long time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it (Oh no, oh no)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

""You can cry a river
'Til an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same, no, no
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you""
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her

And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me

Big chips! Big trips to Vegas, nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward unless the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it, I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this

Rockin Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter

Well, it must be a music thing 'cause she said the same to me
At a party all in my face, while I'm laughing and buying her drinks
She whispered in my ear, said ""Can you take me home?""
Me too! Man, she was in the Chi singing that same song
Is that true?
And I thought it was true confessions when she said ""I love you""

Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt

[Hook - R. Kelly]
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt
[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]
Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
Cuz hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich
And I'm a flirt

[T.I. talking]
Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cuz another man will
Better eat eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz you leave ya wife and I see ya wife
Now be for real, how long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Ya old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cuz you the business type
That's till I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang, sit that right
Up on that dress, see yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G cuz you might catch me
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, put my plan in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

And yo me and ms. thang
We were the perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples dreamed
Love, trust, good sex, and security
If you ever felt weak, smilez was your energy
Trips across seas
Showed you the finer things
No more burger king, it was fine dine cuisine
And if we never had it
I dont think it mattered
We were a class A like Nas and Illmatic
I was so decieved, i thought we had a thing
You used to blow my two way up with 1-4-3s
The l-o-v had me blind i wouldn't have seen
I trusted my friends, all they were yelling at me
How could you do me so wrong
I dont want get gone
I invested three years ma plus this song
Im so confused
Where to go how do i choose
I guess to find real love
I got to pay my dues

(Southstar)
It seemed so good
Yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in
My heart like nobody could
And all along we stood
When times is hard
Even before all this rap shit made me a star
When i was working two jobs just to survive
When i felt like killing my self
You kept me alive
What a pair
Me and you we was a match
Different tastes but you know opposites attract
By my side, held my head and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out where the hell we went wrong
I did what i can young cat being a man
Stayed whethered the storm when most would have ran
Too much pride, and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself, now i had to turn to these rhymes
It's the only way i know to release my mind

(Repeat Chrous)
(Southstar)
Its been a while
Yea you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though, some things still dont pass
Sit back in the pad think, about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad or make me mad
Im trying to move on with my life
The wound is healed
Yea im just speaking it real, im ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed
A man now, bet you can't believe its me

(Smilez)
You ruined a good thing
And all of our dreams
Trying to lock me down a life time in the bing
Monitoring my calls
Piping at mah dogs
Shit, i never really understood the cause
My friends were your friends
Your friends were my friends
Your dough is my dough
My dough is my dough
Mono e mono
We'll foot this weather
And everybody that been through it, then sing it together

The Lonely Island,J**z In My Pants,72,non-hit,"[] Lock eyes from across the room
Down my drink while the rhythms boom
Take your hand and skip the names
No need here for the silly games
Make our way through the smoke and crowd
The club is the sky, and I'm on your cloud
Move in close as the lasers fly
Our bodies touch and the angels cry
Leave this place, go back to yours
Our lips first touch outside your doors
A whole night, what we've got in store
Whisper in my ear that you want some more
And I
Jizz in my pants
This really never happens, you can take my word
I won't apologize, that's just absurd
Mainly your fault for the way that you dance
And now I
Jizz in my pants
Don't tell your friends, or I'll say you're a slut
Plus it's your fault, you were rubbing my butt
I'm very sensitive, some would say that's a plus
Now I'll go home and change
I need a few things from the grocery
Do things alone now mostly
Left me heartbroken not lookin' for love
Surprise in my eyes when I looked above
The checkout counter and I saw her face
My heart stood still, so did time and space
Never felt that I could feel real again
But the look in her eyes said, I need a friend
She turned to me, that's when she said it
Looked me dead in the face, asked, Cash or credit?
And I
Jizzed in my pants
It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me
But we're going to need a cleanup on aisle three
And now I'm posed in an awkward stance
Because I jizzed in my pants
To be fair, you were flirting a lot
Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot
Please, stop acting like you're not impressed
One more thing, I'm gonna pay by check
Last week, I saw a film
As I recall, it was a horror film
Walked outside into the rain
Checked my phone and saw you rang and I
Jizzed in my pants
Speeding down the street when the red lights flash
Need to get away, need to make a dash
A song comes on that reminds me of you and I
Jizz in my pants
The next day, my alarm goes off and I
Jizz in my pants
Open my window and a breeze rolls in and I
Jizz in my pants

The Rock Heroes,All Summer Long,29,hit,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar, talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no Internet but man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things, we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

Never knowing what a couple more bucks

Living right above you in apartment G

For that tight wardrobe

And his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me

Never see the end

[Chorus]
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer
Up Here, My Dear
It won't be long now, it won't be long now13",0.659,0.64,2,-6.544,1,0.0263,0.151,0.00477,0.109,0.211,96.935,179626,4,['rock']
